# Exploding_brains
Particle simulations for exploding brains **in Julia**. This is the successor to the [slowest-particle-simulator-on-earth](https://github.com/ofgulban/slowest-particle-simulator-on-earth). I am going to develop this project further during [OHBM Brainhack 2022](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/). Previous hackathon project are:
1. [2020 OpenMR Benelux](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/124)
2. [2020 OHBM Brainhack](https://github.com/OpenMRBenelux/openmrb2020-hackathon/issues/7)

For further details on the particle simulations read this excellent blog post: https://nialltl.neocities.org/articles/mpm_guide.html
