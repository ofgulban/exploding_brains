# Exploding_brains
Particle simulations for exploding brains in Julia. This is the successor to the [slowest-particle-simulator-on-earth](https://github.com/ofgulban/slowest-particle-simulator-on-earth). I am going to develop this project further during [OHBM Brainhack 2022](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2022/).
